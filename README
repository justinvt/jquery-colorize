color.js is a jquery plugin to allow color operations (darken, lighten, invert, shift hue/saturation/luminance) on page elements.  The project began as a tool to apply "heatmap" like coloration to event calendars (days with more events would appear "hotter," less eventful days would appear "cooler") based on a json object.  It is also useful for darkening/lightening elements that are selected/deselected, inverting the color of items requiring focus, or for dynamically assigning colors to elements while maintaining a consistent color palette

Usage

Basic color getter/setter:

	To obtain a color object from an element:

		var calendar_color = $("div.calendar").color
	
	To set the color of another object to that of the calendar:

		$(".another_element").color(calendar_color)


Color manipulation:

	Color manipulation is done through an API of sorts, whereby
	a command/operation string and numerical arguments are passed to the
	colorTransform function 

	$("div.calendar")
